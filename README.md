# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of cars using machine learning regression models. We explore various regression algorithms such as ElasticNet, Random Forest, Neural Network, and AdaBoost to predict car prices based on their features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Car Price Prediction dataset, which contains information about various car features and their corresponding prices.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chandan062311/CarPrice.git
   ```
2. Install Dependencis:
   pip install -r requirements.txt


Make sure to replace `[Insert R2 score here]` with the actual R2 scores you obtained from running your models. Also, update the `Contributing` and `License` sections according to your project's needs.

Once you've created your README file, save it as `README.md` in the root directory of your GitHub repository. You can then push it to your GitHub repository using Git.
